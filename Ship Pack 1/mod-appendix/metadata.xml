<![CDATA[
This mod replaces all the base ships in Arsenal+ with completely different ships. The ships in this mod each have their own theme separate from the vanilla ship themes, with completely new hull images and ship greebles.

In addition, certain ships have custom variants of the weapons and drones in the base Arsenal+ mod, as well as some ships having custom augments.

Lastly, the Lanius A and Lanius B have been replaced by ships with themes from the two new factions found in Arsenal+.

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
