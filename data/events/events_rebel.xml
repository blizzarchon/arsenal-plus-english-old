<textList name="START_BEACON_REBEL">
	<text>This sector was bustling with activity just a few years ago. Now, more than half of the jump beacons have been destroyed, many settlements have been abandoned and the Rebels patrol constantly.</text>
	<text>This sector was hit hard by the rebellion. The many alien settlements and stations located here are now watched over by almost an equal number of Rebel bases, heavy-handedly 'keeping the peace'.</text>
	<text>Once the Federation forces were scattered, the Rebels came down hard on the locals here. Between the 'tax collectors' and military bases, the Rebel presence in this sector is high.</text>
	<text>At one point this was one of the most commonly traveled sectors. Knowing that, the Rebels have stationed a number of fleets here. Be careful.</text>
	<text>You will have to be very cautious in this sector. The Rebels have full control and are no doubt looking for you.</text>
	<text>You have reached the Rebel sector. The war with the Federation has affected the entire infrastructure of this place: everything here now serves the Rebels. Vigilant patrols fly all throughout, so don't expect to pass through without a fight.</text>
	<text>This sector was captured by the rebellion specifically to cut off your path to the Federation base. Your crew give one another a fearful glance, but return to their stations ready to work. You may be able to get through yet.</text>
	<!-- no, I really have no idea what the ending meant -->
	<text>There are Rebels ahead of you, and Rebels behind you, a bit too much arrogance as of late...</text>
	<text>In this sector, Rebels are in charge — everywhere there is devastation, desolation, and roaming patrols of "liberators". This is what awaits the Federation, if you do not succeed in your mission.</text>
	<text>You are in enemy territory. Extra caution won't hurt. That is of course, if you don't seek to attract the Rebels to you...</text>
	<text>Once this was a peaceful trade sector, but everything changed when the Rebels arrived. Now their ships dart everywhere in search of Federation supporters, and you risk running into one of them.</text>
</textList>

<event name="STORE_REBEL">

	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_REBEL">
	<text>You discover a re-supply station used by Rebels and civilians alike. You transmit your fake ship identification and for once, they don't seem to recognize your ship. You try to assume the air of a local as you prepare to dock.</text>
	<text>You arrive at a small space station that is putting out wide-band broadcasts on black-market channels. You doubt they would turn away any business, regardless of allegiances.</text>
	<text>You receive generic advertisements from a nearby public ship-yard. It seems they are willing to work on any ship, not only those of Rebel hue.</text>

</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_REBEL">
	<text>You enter a system bustling with Rebel activity. Supply freighters and re-supply stations are dwarfed by a few heavy warships. Luckily, no one seems to be paying attention to small cruisers. No ships are scanning or messaging you.</text>
	<text>You arrive near a small Rebel refueling depot. Your ship is being scanned multiple times so they must recognize you, but there appears to be no combat-ready ships in the vicinity. The only message you receive is a denial to your request to dock at the depot.</text> 
	<text>There is not much of interest nearby. A small sun in the distance with a few orbiting planets in nearby space provide little of interest.</text>
	<text planet="NONE">There are no other ships near this beacon, however you detect a small communication relay. You tap into it without a problem; there is no encryption. Most of the chatter revolves around troop and fleet movements, not particularly interesting.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">There is a small planet nearby with scattered settlements. A small Rebel fleet is in orbit with many ships ferrying back and forth. It must be a more recently 'liberated' planet.</text>

	<text>You discover one of the Rebel's autonomous scouts. The ship's AI wastes no time in engaging your ship.</text>
	<text>Your ship is hailed: "This is an automated message. Resisting our takeover is pointless. Prepare to die." It appears this Rebel ship is run by an AI.</text>
	<text>A Rebel autonomous scout is exploring this beacon. You attempt to hide behind a nearby moon, but the ship finds you and begins its assault.</text>
	<text>The AI of a nearby small Rebel scout immediately identifies you as a threat and engages.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship moves in to engage. You attempt to open communications, but realize the futility of that action when you see the ship is run by an AI.</text>
	<text>This must be one of the Rebels' unmanned scout ships. Looks like there's no way around a fight.</text>
	<text>Another unmanned ship patrols this area. You prepare the ship for combat.</text>
	<text>This beacon is being patrolled by a unmanned scout. A fight is unavoidable.</text>

<event name="AUTO_HACKER" unique="true">

	<text>A small Rebel ship is docked at a small station. You try to lay low but it spots you. Power up the weapons!</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship has been patrolling this region. As soon as you arrive it begins its assault.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails you: "Federation scum! We've waited a long time for this!"</text>
	<text>You receive a transmission: "Sorry sir, this is nothing personal but we're under orders." The Rebel ship's weapons go hot.</text>
	<text>By the time you notice the Rebel ship behind the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship approaches cautiously. "Personally," says the captain, "I'd have stuck with the Federation. But I'm a soldier, sir, and I'm no use without a war to fight. Raise your shields!"</text>
	<text>You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship is guarding this beacon. You order a pursuit course and prepare to scratch up one more.</text>
