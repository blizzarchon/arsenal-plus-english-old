</event>

<textList name="START_BEACON_MANTIS">
	<text>You've entered a poorly charted area of space that's known to be home to the Mantis. Ensure your hull plating is up to scratch and that you have enough fuel in the tank to make it through.</text>
	<text>You've arrived in a Mantis sector. Few lucky people can boast of having left this place without noticeable damage. Keep your eyes peeled and wits about you.</text>
	<text>You've arrived in a sector with the reputation of a space Bermuda Triangle. Only in the past cycle, more than one hundred ships have gone missing in this area. Rumor has it they were captured by an insect-like race...</text>
	<text>This sector is populated by intelligent Mantises, and their ships are equipped with teleportation technologies. It'd probably be best to check your medical equipment is up to scratch and strengthen your doors.</text>
	<text>Arriving in the sector, you intercept click-squeaking sounds of negotiations communication from a nearby asteroid field. Looks like the Mantis are up to something. Be careful.</text>
	<text>You arrive in the sector of an unfriendly race of giant mantises. Perhaps jumping here may not have been the best idea...</text>
	<text>At the start beacon of this sector, you find an Engi pinned to its side. The bloodthirst of the Mantis can only be rivaled by their aggressiveness.</text>
	<text>In the old war, the Federation defeated the Mantis. It's time to remind these cockroaches who's in the kitchen with a shoe!</text>
	<text>You've arrived in a Mantis sector. It's unlikely it'll be anything compared to a pleasant walk: these large intelligent insects are infamous for their brutality. It's better to be safe than sorry and check that all of your systems are ready for combat duty.</text>
	<text>You've arrived in Mantis territory. Not every captain can boast of having left this sector with their ship unscathed.... or at least just left this sector in the first place...</text>
</textList>

<event name="STORE_MANTIS">
	<text load="STORE_MANTIS"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="STORE_MANTIS">
	<text>Upon arriving at the beacon, you're hailed by a well-spoken Mantis, "Hail, traveler. These are dangerous times. Perhaps you find yourself in need of our services?" He appears to be a trader.</text>
	<text>Uncertain about what you'll discover at this beacon, you scan the surroundings. You detect several warnings on wide-band channels discouraging any violence in protected trade-space. Perhaps you can find some wares nearby.</text>
	<text>Merchants are not highly respected among the Mantis race, so few undertake the profession. You're mildly surprised to receive an advertisement from a nearby space dock. You decide to see what they have to offer.</text>
	<text>Identifying a Mantis trading post ahead, you signal them so that your approach won't be taken as a threat. The leader hails you: "You have scrap? Quickly, come dock before the warriors see you."</text>
	<text>A struggling Mantis cargo ship headed for the node raises what's left of shields as you jump in. You power up your weapons as a show of force, and they reluctantly agree to offload some of their cargo to you - for a price.</text>
	<text>The Rebels are already here! The crew braces for impact, but none comes. The sensors report the unmanned rebel supply ship is malfunctioning and is stuck in vending mode â€” for a little scrap you can take your pick.</text>

</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_MANTIS">
	<text>At this point you almost expect a fight with the Mantis, but this beacon appears to be entirely devoid of other ships. You take the time to catch your breath and double check the ship's systems.</text>
	<text>The only thing this beacon offers is a view of deep space and a brief respite from battles. For some this must be a welcome refuge.</text>
	<text>A nearby Mantis mining operation is clearly using heavy Engi slave labor. You briefly consider the possibility of emancipating the slaves, but the Mantis presence is too formidable. You decide to lay low.</text>
	<text>There aren't so many parts of Mantis space that aren't dotted by the wrecks of battles past, but this is one of them. You take a deep breath and prepare to move on.</text>
	<text>There's nothing here but space debris and some uninhabitable planetoids.</text>
	<text>You fancy you see something moving in the shadow of the beacon, but all remains still.</text>

	<!-- These are the ones that I had written-->
	<text>A Mantis military ship appears on local radar alongside the remains of a human freighter. Prepare for a hostile encounter!</text>
	<text>A Mantis military scout hails your ship. "Foolish alien! Your kind has stifled our greatness for too long! You will rue the day you backed the Federation!"</text>
	<text>A small Mantis cruiser is broadcasting a repeating message on a wide-band frequency, "All non-Mantis ships that enter our territory are forfeit. Lower your shields and surrender if you value your lives."</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">You detect a small military outpost and a few freighters nearby. This mineral rich planet in an isolated location would be perfect for an illegal Mantis mining operation. As you consider your options, a ship launches from the outpost. Prepare for a fight.</text>
	<text>You discover yet another unlicensed and uncharted Mantis colony. They certainly waste no time expanding their claims. A Mantis ship moves to intercept you before you can jump away.</text>
	<text>A Mantis military scout seems to have just finished a salvage op on a nearby wreck. They have no time to waste with warnings and appear to wish to fight.</text>
	<text>A small military craft hails you and a Mantis captain appears on your receiver. "All local human colonies have been punished for the Federation's transgressions. Submit to processing."</text>
	<!-- These are the ones by tom-->
	<text>A nearby Mantis ship begins aggressive maneuvers. You prepare for the worst.</text>
	<text>A stream of clicks and gurgling comes on the comm from a hostile Mantis scout. The universal translator might be on the blink, but his intent is obvious.</text>
	<text>The Mantis ship is pleased to see you, and fires up its weapon systems.</text>
	<text>You recognize the outline of a Mantis ship against the blackness. Engage!</text>
	<text>Something red looms. It's the Mantis.</text>
	<text>A Mantis vessel hails you. "This hail is merely a distraction!" You notice their shields and weapons have come online.</text>
	<text>You notice a flurry of laser fire glance by the port window. The Mantis are upon you.</text>
	<text>The Mantis hail you. Their captain says, "I claim this vessel for my clan. Good hunting!"</text>
	<text>A Mantis female comes on the vidscreen. The females don't make it to authority unless they're particularly vicious. You power the weapons.</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship with the markings of a warrior tribe breaks position and attacks!</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship hails: "Ah! Fine prey. Fine prey! We honor you with our most eviscerating arsenal!" You sense a cloud to this silver lining and power the weapons.</text>
	<text>Children on Earth are told terrible tales of the blood red Mantis invasion ships - much like the one bearing down on you now - which once threatened the planet. You order weapons free!</text>
	<text>A youthful-looking Mantis captain hails. "You, prey, must know. Your death, Kaaazthwak's final kill before maturity. Kaaazthwak pay respects." Seems respects in Mantis culture are paid with lasers.</text>
