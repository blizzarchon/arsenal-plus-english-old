	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The Mantis have been threatening the Engi core worlds, but you should be able to stock up for your journey.</text>
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. The fall of the Federation has brought tough times for these robotic lifeforms, but they're usually willing to help.</text>
	<text>You have arrived in Engi space. These masters of engineering will happily help the Federation, however in the current situation, their trust must first be earned.</text>
	<text>In this sector, there are many ships with advanced drone technologies. Perhaps they can help you break away from the pursuing Rebel Fleet.</text>
	<text>You arrive in the once quite peaceful Engi sector. These mechanized organisms can easily patch up your ship's hull. For a suitable fee, of course.</text>
	<text>"01010111 01100101 01101100 01100011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100001" â€” These numbers inscripted on the entry beacon seem to be a greeting message in binary! Oh those Engi...</text> <!-- "Welcome!" -->
	<text>The Engi have always been faithful allies of the Federation. They are ready to help even now, when the chance of Federation victory is extremely slim...</text>
	<text>You have arrived in a sector belonging to the Engi. This race is famous for its adept engineering skills, so if you still haven't thought about replenishing supplies or patching up your ship â€” now is the right time.</text><!-- 'now is the most suitable time.' ? -->

	<store/>
</event>
<!-- if sale is so necessary for engine upgrade, then that means if you don't buy anything... well, the Engi don't feel fear... -->
<textList name="STORE_ENGI">
	<text>The Engi can do remarkable things with just a pile of scrap. The Engi hive at this beacon are selling equipment for just that.</text>
	<text>A message arrives: "Your scrap, ours. Our weapons for you." You're about to raise the shields when you realize it's just an Engi trader looking for a trade.</text>
	<text>An Engi ship hails: "Engine upgrade necessary for travel home. Sale of equipment necessary for engine upgrade."</text>

	</choice>
</event>
<textList name="NOTHING_ENGI">
	<text>The complex arrangements of ship hulls and FTL drive capacitors floating abandoned in space suggest the Engi were here not too long ago; but no longer.</text>
	<text planet="green_planet">You arrive at a green planet with great plains and rolling waterfalls. It would be of little interest to the Engi nearby.</text>  <!-- JUSTIN TO DO-  MAKE GREEN PLANET-->
	<text>You have arrived near an Engi construction yard. Most Engi maintain their bi-pedal appearance out of habit but here you see a number of Engi hives working together to create massive organic machines adept at building ships. Truly a sight to behold.</text>
	<text>Even though each "individual" Engi is made up of trillions of nano-machines, their culture still revolves around traditional social interactions. A nearby station seems to be constructed for entertainment of passing Engi travellers.</text>
	<text>You see a number of Engi space stations and fleets nearby. Despite looking like piles of junk loosely tied together they are actually a model of efficiency. They just lack a certain aesthetic emphasis in their constructions.</text>
	<text>This system appears quite peaceful. You're not sure how long it'll last between the combined threats of the Rebels and Mantis.</text><!-- the Russian version includes a "However" which would be used regardless of the rest of the sentence structure, however ( ;] ), the vanilla version carries the message equally well, so it is unnecessary to include it: a note for future texts where when it seems something was added to the original text, but actually not really --> 
	<text>There are a number of merchant ships passing through the area despite the threat of Mantis invasion. No doubt interested in buying the efficient technology of the Engi.</text>
	<text>You see a small Rebel carrier in the distance. You lay low and try to blend in with the other traffic. However it's surprising to see a Rebel military ship alone deep in Engi space.</text>
	<text>The Engi seem to have avoided this particular node, along with every other life-form. You keep your eyes peeled for reasons why, but spin up the FTL without event.</text>
	<text planet="PLANET_POPULATED_SMALL">A cluster of Engi satellites in orbit of a nearby planet are the only clue the mechanical species was ever here. You have other places to be.</text>

	<text>You cross paths with an Engi cargo vessel hurrying home before the Mantis fleets attempt to take over this sector. They're happy to offload some of their cargo to get home faster.</text>
	<text>You make contact with an isolated Engi science station who are staying put despite the likelihood of Mantis invasion. They suggest you trial some experimental technology.</text>
	<text>This was the site of a recent battle. Either a show of Mantis force, or the Engi here weren't disposed to go peacefully. You pick through the pieces.</text>
