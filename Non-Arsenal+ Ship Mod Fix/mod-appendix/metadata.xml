<![CDATA[
Should be placed after all non-Arsenal+ ship mods that you wish to use. Should NOT be placed after ship mods designed for Arsenal+ and instead before.

It has come to my attention that ship mods don't exactly play correctly when used with Arsenal+ because Arsenal+ redefines vanilla blueprints as other weapons, leading to problems.

This mod is here to fix those problems so that the ships have the weapons and drones they were supposed to have.

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
