Changes all the ships to a different set of ships, for the most part mini-versions of enemy mini-bosses. As such, they may possibly spoil parts of Arsenal+ for you... you were warned!

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
