This mod contains the data for the Arsenal+ game expansion. Must be loaded alongside the Arsenal+ English Resource Pack for Arsenal+ to work properly.

Arsenal+ is a Cyrillic FTL mod that combines assets from other total conversion mods such as Captain's Edition and Insurrection, along with weapons from various other mods, with a plethora of original content mixed in to expand the game, bringing in a whole new FTL experience.

The events, although probably inspired by other mods, are all original to this mod. Furthermore, though this mod uses assets from other mods for the initial creation of weapons, drones, etc., but the ending balance and characteristics of these assets are specific to this mod.

Captain's Edition's assets are correctly given credit, and Captain's Edition can be found here: https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15663

    Suggestions for the description...

    Write a short paragraph about the mod's effect first (what style ship,
    how does it affect gameplay). No need to introduce yourself.

    Optionally add a paragraph of background flavor.

    Optionally list important features.

    List any concerns about mod compatibility, preferred order, or
    requirements.

    Mention "Replaces the XYZ ship." if relevant.
      Kestrel-A, Stealth-A, Mantis-A,
      Engi-A,    Fed-A,     Slug-A,
      Rock-A,    Zoltan-A,  Crystal-A

    Above all, keep the description general, so you won't have to edit
    that again for each new version.
