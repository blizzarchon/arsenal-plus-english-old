<!-- <text name="faded_description">Nicknamed "The 'Ole Standard", this laser used to be quite something back in its day. Unfortunately, its inscription is faded away beyond recognition, so nobody has any way of knowing what it was.</text> -->
<!-- <text name="lore_oldLaser">An old laser from the depths of obsolescence...</text> -->

<text name="ce_tip_chain_laser_light">Tip: Light lasers can pass through weak shields and super shields to injure enemy crew, but cannot deplete shields or deal hull damage. Chain lasers decrease in cooldown each time they fire.</text> -->

<!-- <text name="tip_no_missiles">Tip: This weapon is improved so that it no longer consumes ammo.</text> --><!-- potentially discuss where you got the replicator weapon from -->
<!-- <text name="ce_tip_mines">Tip: Mines ignore all enemy shields, but require 1 missile to launch, and cannot damage systems or crew. Enemy defense drones can shoot them down.</text> -->
<!-- <text name="ce_tip_mines_tech">Tip: Techno-mines contain a stealth system that allows them to bypass basic defense drones. They ignore all enemy shields, but require 1 missile to launch and don't deal any damage to systems and crew. Advanced defense drones can still shoot them down.</text> -->

<!-- <text name="ce_tip_beams_industrial">Tip: Industrial beams charge and fire extremely slowly, but have tremendous length. Highly likely that enemy shields will recharge and block part of the beam damage.</text> -->
<!-- Tip: Industrial beams are extremely long, but charge and fire extremely slowly.
