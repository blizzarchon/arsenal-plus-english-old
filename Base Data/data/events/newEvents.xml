<!--    
	  ***********
       TEXT LISTS				  
	  ***********		
-->

<textList name="TIPS_LIST">
	<text>TIP: Death — Remember, losing is part of the fun! ... No, I'm serious...</text>
	<text>TIP: Grinding Sectors — It can be beneficial to stay in a Sector for as long as possible to improve the ship since each Sector is increasingly difficult.</text>
	<text>TIP: Exits — It's tempting to rush for the Sector exits, but exploring is the only way to upgrade your ship. Try and get as much out of each Sector as possible.</text>
	<text>TIP: Targets — Prioritize your targeting in combat. Weapons and Shields are usually the best choice, but if they're fleeing, hit their Engines or Piloting to prevent escape.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hidden Choices — When you see a blue colored choice in an event, it's a special option that has been made available by your current equipment, but isn't always the best or the safest way to go.</text><!-- 1.25 -->
	<text>TIP: System Damage — When a System fully breaks due to fire or boarders, the hull also takes one damage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Power Bars — Upgraded Systems can be helpful even if you don't have enough reactor power to use them; they still absorb one damage.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapons — You can queue up an attack before the weapon is charged. It will fire when it's charged.</text>
	<text>TIP: Cloaking — Cloaking prevents enemies from firing on your ship or charging their weapons. It also increases your base evasion by 60.</text>
	<text>TIP: Boarding — If you're having trouble with boarders, fight within the medbay. If all else fails, vent the rest of the oxygen out of the ship!</text>
	<text>TIP: Oxygen — If the ship's room color changes from tan to red, it means you're losing oxygen. Crew will be damaged and fires will burn out in rooms with red hazard stripes.</text>
	<text>TIP: Shield Piercing — Missiles ignore shields. Use missiles to damage a powerful ship's Shields System. Just remember that Defense Drones can shoot down missiles!</text>
	<text>TIP: Choices — Results of most choices have multiple outcomes. You can never be sure what will happen.</text>
	<text>TIP: Autofire — Autofire will let a weapon maintain its target. Just keep an eye on your missile count!</text>
	<text>TIP: Evasion — Evading enemy shots is crucial, but it requires functioning engines AND a pilot. Having someone man the engines will increase your evasion as well.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sensors — If the ship goes dark, don't panic. Just fix the Sensors Subsystem.</text>
	<text>TIP: Drones — If you're struggling against enemy Drones, target the Drone System to temporarily disable them.</text>
	<text>TIP: Beams — Beam weapons do damage based on the number of rooms they hit. Each Shield bubble will block 1 damage of a beam; it's best to use beams when the enemy's shields are down.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fire — If fire is spreading, consider opening airlocks and doors to vent the oxygen from parts of your ship. Fire is quickly extinguished without O2.</text>
	<text>TIP: Health — Pay attention to your crew's health! Use the Medbay to keep them patched up.</text>
	<text>TIP: Upgrades — Don't forget to upgrade your ship! Often shields are the highest priority, but don't underestimate the usefulness of subsystems.</text>
	<text>TIP: Fuel — Every jump consumes one unit of fuel, so keep an eye on your reserves. Buy fuel at stores to avoid being left stranded.</text>
	<text>TIP: Sound — Go into the options menu to turn on or off the sound effects and music.</text>
	<text>TIP: Asteroids — Fighting in asteroid fields is dangerous, but use it to your advantage. Take out enemy Shields and let the rocks take care of the rest.</text>
	<text>TIP: Nebulas — Passing through a Nebula will allow you to temporarily slow down the fleet advancement but they contain their own unique dangers.</text>
	<text>TIP: Solar Flares — Solar flares will cause hull damage in addition to starting fires. Make sure your shields are up to help mitigate this effect.</text>
	<text>TIP: Score — Your score is based on how many ships you defeat, the number of beacons explored, and your total scrap collection.</text>
	<text>TIP: Augmentations — Your ship can only hold 3 augmentations. They provide unique benefits to a system, the crew or the entire ship.</text>
	<text>TIP: Breaches — If a room with a breach has no Oxygen, try opening all the doors surrounding it to make it less hazardous.</text>
	<text>TIP: Rebel Fleet — The Rebel fleet (represented by the red circle on the map) moves closer to your position every time you jump. Certain events can slow or speed up their movement.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ion Weapons — Ion weapons de-power and lock a System for a time. If they hit the enemy shields they deal their stun damage directly to the Shields System.</text>
	<text>TIP: Bomb Weapons — Bombs teleport directly onto either ship. They bypass Shields AND Defense Drones. However, they affect only crew and Systems; they do no damage to the ship's hull.</text>
	<text>TIP: Door Subsystem — Upgrading your doors will greatly reduce the chance of fire spreading between rooms and will significantly slow boarder movement.</text>
	<!-- new! -->
	<text>TIP: Crew Dialogues — If the sector in which you are in is native to the crew member, then dialogue with them on an empty beacon has a better chance of yielding something beneficial. Humans may have family members in the Civilian and Rebel sectors.</text><!-- 1.25, added sentence -->
	<text>TIP: Store Availability — The number of store beacons in a sector depends upon its color. Green sectors have 2-3 stores, red sectors 1-2 stores, and purple sectors 1-3 stores. The starting sector has only one store.</text><!-- now one store | 1.25 added sentence about no stores -->
	<text>TIP: Trade Sector — There are 5 stores in the trade sector, and the number of dangerous beacons is less than in other sectors. There are also rumors of illegal equipment being sold there.</text>
	<text>TIP: Prototypes — Prototypes are the most powerful weapons that you can get, but they often need the support of other weapons. To find prototypes, visit your native race-specific sectors.</text>
	<text>TIP: Crystal Homeworlds — The native crystalline homewords can sometimes be found in the 6th or 7th sector on the sector map. It contains only the rarest types of weaponry, as well as unique crystal weapons and drones.</text>
	<text>TIP: AI Ships — Avatars' ships are equipped with protection from ion weaponry and unique prismatic lasers, causing normal and ion damage simultaneously.</text>
	<text>TIP: Augment Special Features — At the start beacons of sectors 2 through 7, you can use special capabilities of ship augmentations. Their use will not always be successful or safe, so be careful.</text>
	<text>TIP: Ancient Lanius Weaponry — The Lanius have preserved information about old photonic weaponry. While not all that accurate, they still have the potential to devastate ships and crew alike.</text>
	<text>TIP: Order Sectors — Passing through Order sectors can lead to your ship being set on fire. Make sure you have a fire-fighting system installed.</text>
	<text>TIP: Order Ships — Order Ships are equipped with incendiary weapons and fire extinguishing systems. Some ship classes also have upgraded engines.</text>
	<text>TIP: Unstable Sectors — Unstable Sectors are known as one of the most dangerous sectors in the Galaxy. Here, pirate and hacker groups have found a haven.</text>
	<!-- 1.21 -->
	<text>TIP: Elite Auto Surveyors — Elite Auto Surveyors are found only in Rebel sectors. Armed to the teeth and possessing the ability to seal breaches, they're far more dangerous than the usual Auto Scout, but defeating them can yield great rewards.</text>
	<text>TIP: HAL Ships — HAL ships don't have a weapons system, but are equipped with ionic phase artillery, which damages the crew. Their combat drones are protected by a defense scrambler, rendering anti-drones useless.</text>
	<text>TIP: HAL On-board Computer — When HAL ships receive damage, they may turn on a backup power supply which increases reactor power. However, sometimes the damage can be fatal to the on-board computer.</text>
	<text>TIP: HAL Drones — HAL Drones are the fastest and most destructive in the Galaxy. A separate mention is the HAL System Repair Drone, capable of working even when the drones system is destroyed.</text>
	<!-- 1.23 -->
	<text>TIP: Single-Charge Installations — These experimental weapons platforms can only be found in Nebula Sectors. They don't require any power, but can only fire once per battle.</text>
	<text>TIP: Border Sector — In the border sector there are representatives from all races. It's here that the main front line of the war with the Rebels takes place.</text>
	<text>TIP: Drones System — By purchasing a drones system from the store, as a gift you will receive a random drone from one of three categories — Combat, Defensive, or Support.</text>
	<!-- 1.25 -->
	<text>TIP: The Black Wing — Blackwing cruisers are advanced Rebel cruisers equipped with indestructible weapons systems and chase your ship without ASB support fire, but defeating them can yield great rewards.</text>
	<text>TIP: Slig Ships — Slig ships are almost impossible to board because their cloning system is protected from direct damage. However, it is still vulnerable to fire.</text>
	<text>TIP: Engi Repair Stations — Repair stations are in half of all Engi sectors, except for the Engi homeworlds, in which there is always a repair station. The stations provide repair services and provide supplies for a small fee.</text>
	<text>TIP: The Rebel Flagship — The higher the difficulty, the stronger the flagship's artilleries. With each difficulty level, the ion artillery recharges faster, the missiles and lasers start fires and cause breaches more often, and the beam's span becomes longer. The Flagship's hull strength and coloration also changes depending on the difficulty.</text>
	<!-- 1.25.2 | 1.26 added Auto-Destroyers -->
	<text>TIP: Auto-Ships — Some auto-drones have extra augments installed: Auto-Hackers stun hack their enemies, Auto-Aggressors use one auto-reloader and Auto-Destroyers use two auto-reloaders.</text>
	<!-- 1.26 -->
	<text>TIP: Injectors — Injectors are augments that can amplify your weapons' properties. Use them at the start of sectors, but keep in mind an injector can only upgrade one weapon in total. Injectors cannot be used on weapons an injector has already been used on, or those which don't have the property the injector amplifies.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zolton Beams — Zolton beams are one and a half times as long as usual and have an increased chance to light fires or cause a breach. To function, 30 missiles must be kept in the hold, but they are not spent each time the beam fires. Such beams on enemy ships can function without missiles.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zolton Ion Weapons — Zolton ion weapons combine the properties of heavy ion and burst ion weapons.</text>
	<text>TIP: UWB-Weapons — UWB-Weapons are universal shells used by smugglers to hide which weapon is actually inside. The UWB-Weapon's shell is specially designed to reduce the cooldown of the weapon inside by 10%. However, the UWB-Weapon's shell cannot hold a bomb weapon.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zolton Ships — Unlike the Zoltans, the Zoltons don't have a protective Super Shield. Instead, their shield systems are immune to direct damage, but fires and heavy ion weaponry can still damage them. Zolton ships are equipped with a weak reactor and a backup battery.</text>
	<text>TIP: Zolton Auto-Drones — Like the manned Zolton ships, the Zolton auto-drones have invulnerable shield systems, a weak reactor, and a backup battery. They guard the nebulae of the Zolton sectors.</text>
	<text>TIP: Artilleries — You can purchase an artillery system in stores. Which weapon the artillery holds depends on your ship's class. Store-bought artillery systems already come with two power capacity.</text>
	<!-- 1.26.3 -->
	<text>TIP: Universal Injector — its bonus depends on the type of weapon to which the injector is applied:
	Lasers, ions: 50% faster projectile speed, +15 crew damage.
	Missiles, mines, crystal weapons, hullcrushers: +1 base damage.
	Bombs, effectors: +1 bomb/shot.
	AoE weapons: 30% smaller radius — less projectile spreading.
	Long beams: 25% faster beam firing and 25% longer beam span.
	Point beams: +1 system damage.</text>
	<!-- 1.26.4 -->
	<text>TIP: Legendary Weapons — Legendary weapons are very rare as they are found only in unique sectors (except for the Trade, Border, and Slig Abode sectors). These weapons are incredibly powerful.</text>

	<text load="TIPS_LIST"/>
	<text>TIP: Pausing — Press SPACE at any time to pause the game. You can still issue orders to crew or manipulate system power while paused.</text>
	<text>TIP: Selling — Weapons, Drones and Augments can be sold for 1/2 the purchasing price at stores. Click on the SELL tab at the top.</text>
	<text>TIP: Hotkeys — You can charge or arm weapons using number hotkeys: The Weapon Slots are 1-4 on your keyboard, and the Drones are 5-7 (customizeable in the options).</text>
	<text>TIP: Font Size — Pressing +/- (customizable in options) will let you change the event text size.</text>
	<text>TIP: Weapon Order — Rearrange a Weapon or Drone schematic by dragging it into the desired position. The left-most slot will be the last to power down if the system is damaged.</text>
