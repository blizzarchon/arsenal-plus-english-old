<textList name="START_BEACON_NEBULA">
	<text>This nebula must have been an important hub at one point; placing all of these jump beacons would be no easy task. However, now it's hardly navigable.</text>
	<text>Nebulas were always dangerous places. Many electronics fail in these clouds. You will have to tread lightly.</text>
	<text>You've entered a sector thick with nebulas. You'll have to navigate on instinct.</text>
	<text>You've entered a nebula-rich sector. You may put a few light years on the fleet, but that's only useful if you make it out the other side.</text>
	<text>Thanks to the high nebula density of this sector very little of it has been charted, and rumours of what lurks in the depths abound.</text>
	<text>The gases that make up the nebulas in this sector threaten to impair your systems; but you have to press on.</text>
	<text>You've reached an uncharted nebula. The outside environment won't be so pleasant for the pursuing Fleet, but don't rejoice just yet — this also applies to you. Try to reach the exit to the next area without having on-board sensors activated.</text>
	<text>The only reference points in this sector are the high-frequency electromagnetic pulses of the jump beacons. Who knows who else these beacons may attract?..</text>
	<text>A strong magnetic storm rages in this nebula. It'd probably be best to turn off sensitive sensor systems, otherwise you risk losing them until the very end of your mission.</text>
	<text>Electronics breakdown, sensors failure, and much more await you on this course...</text>
	<text>This sector is densely packed with nebulae. Well, at least this will give you a good chance to collect more resources. Just don't forget about the Rebels...</text>
	<text>The good news is that you can easily lose the Rebels in the nebula. The bad news is that you can just as easily get in trouble...</text>
	<text>As soon as you enter the nebula, the sensor system fails. It's encouraging that Rebel pursuit will be slower here. But that's about it... You'll have to try to find a way out of here.</text>
	<text>The uncharted nebula isn't a place you want to stay in for long. Try to find a way out of here as soon as possible.</text>
</textList>

<!-- for when the fleet takes over a nebula beacon -->
<event name = "FLEET_EASY_NEBULA">
	<text>An advanced Rebel hunter easily found your ship. You can't see it through the nebula, but you can assume the fleet is right on top of you. You need to escape quickly.</text>
	<ship load = "LONG_FLEET" hostile ="true"/>
	<environment type="storm"/>

<event name="NEBULA_STORE">
	<text load="NEBULA_STORE"/>
	<environment type="nebula"/>
	<store/>
</event>
<textList name="NEBULA_STORE">
	<text>Some brave entrepreneurs set up a station here to extract elements from the nebula. There seems to be a public shipyard and rest stop here as well.</text>
	<text>Seeing a trade depot set up near the beacon implies there is an alien settlement on some nearby rock. You decide to check out their wares.</text>
	<text>The centre of a hydrogen cloud doesn't seem like a very usual place for a store, but the Engi aren't a usual species. Wouldn't hurt to take a look.</text>
	<text>An Engi cargo vessel hails: "Propose mutually beneficial exchange of properties." That smells like a bargain.</text>
	<text>You discover a cluster of Federation refugee ships taking shelter in the folds of the nebula. "I'm sorry we've got nothing to give you, but we need scrap to keep the engines running." You sense they'll strike a trade.</text>
</textList>

		<event load="TALK_WITH_CREW_GHOST"/>
	</choice>
</event>
<textList name ="NEBULA_EMPTY_LIST">
	<text>You can't see anything through the thick gases surrounding your ship. Without knowing what is out there, all you can do is wait for your FTL to charge.</text>
	<text>Without active sensors you have no other option but to look out of the view-ports in apprehension. It's eerily quiet.</text>
	<text>As you wait for the FTL drive to charge, you half expect to be ambushed at any moment. However, no attack comes...</text>
	<text>You feel naked without functioning sensors. You half expect a Rebel ship to appear from behind a cloud at any moment, but none come.</text>
	<text>Your crew are constantly looking out of the windows, checking for hostiles. They jump at every creak and moan of the ship. The tension is almost palpable...</text>
	<text>You nervously glance out the windows but the only thing to greet you is more clouds and silence.</text>
	<text>You cycle through wide-band comm channels as soon as you arrive. Nothing but static.</text>
	<text>With the sensors down, you spend a good deal of time staring out the window. It is, you must admit, rather beautiful here.</text>
	<text>There's nothing here, save for vast swirls of gas reflecting rays from a distant sun.</text>

	<environment type="nebula"/>
</event>
<textList name="NEBULA_REBEL_LIST">
	<text>You cross paths with an advance scout of the Rebel fleet searching this section of the nebula for your ship.</text>
	<text>A ship bearing Rebel colors can be seen waiting near the beacon. They must have been waiting for you, since they engage immediately.</text>
	<text>The Rebels must have anticipated you would try to lose them within the nebula. A scout is waiting for you at the beacon.</text>
	<text>It looks like you will be unable to avoid the Rebels by traveling through the nebula. A Rebel ship is waiting for you near the beacon.</text>
	<text>Shortly after you arrive, a Rebel ship jumps nearby. There looks to be no escape. Prepare for a fight!</text>
	<text>Newton-knows what brings this Rebel ship so far out; its captain hails, but does a double take when he identifies your ship. They open fire.</text>
	<text>A Rebel ship hails, but you don't take chances in conditions like this. You block the frequency and prepare to engage.</text>
</textList>


<event name="NEBULA_AUTO">
	<text load="NEBULA_AUTO_LIST"/>

	<environment type="nebula"/>
</event>
<textList name="NEBULA_AUTO_LIST">
	<text>You cross paths with an advance scout of the Rebel fleet searching this section of the nebula for your ship.</text>
	<text>You jump into a calmer part of the nebula. However, your relief fades as a Rebel scout jumps to the beacon and moves in to attack.</text>
	<text>The tangled wrecks of many ships wait in dormancy here. You see lights flicker on what looks like debris. A Rebel scout bursts out of the wreckage!</text>
	<text>This drone isn't looking for you. Perhaps it's scouting ahead for the Rebel expansion or maybe they're seeking to use this nebula for cover. Regardless, it identifies you as hostile.</text>
	<text>It's worrying that the Rebels have penetrated so deep into uncharted space, even if it is only an unmanned craft. It arms its weapons; you should do the same.</text>
</textList>


<event name="NEBULA_AUTO_WARNING" unique = "true">
	<text>It appears that an automated Rebel scout was positioned within the nebula to warn of your passing.</text>

	<text load="NEBULA_PIRATE"/>
	<ship load="PIRATE" hostile="true"/>
</event>
<textList name="NEBULA_PIRATE">	<!-- JUSTIN — ADD MORE -->
	<text>As you drift through the nebula an unmarked vessel descends from the clouds and into your wake. Their weapons come online.</text>
	<text>A pirate ship pulls out of the ether and hails: "You know what I love about this part of the galaxy? The explorers! You always carry such fine loot." They lock weapons.</text>
	<text>As you coast through the nebula a pirate ship matches your course and closes the distance. Better to pick your battleground, but beggars can't be choosers.</text>
	<text>A hostile vessel descends from out of the nebula. Combat stations!</text>
	<text>You try to read the ID of a ship ahead in the fog, but it's too thick to penetrate. You have your answer when the ship turns, weapons hot!</text>

	<ship load="MANTIS_FIGHT" hostile="true"/>
	<environment type="nebula"/>
</event>
<textList name="NEBULA_MANTIS_FIGHT">
	<text>Nebulas are known to be popular Mantis hunting grounds. Information you would have done well to heed here.</text>
	<text>You detect a Mantis expedition vessel returning home with its haul. So determined are they, in fact, that they don't wait to see if you're hostile before firing.</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship, lost in the storm, hails you. "Sensors are out. We have no local telemetry. We will take yours." You detect a power increase in their weapons systems.</text>
	<text>A Mantis ship hails you through the storm: "These are sacred Urggghtnag clan hunting grounds. You are prey." Shields up!</text>
	<text>You notice a Mantis attack ship ducking between the clouds of swirling space stuff; it's hunting you. You try to get the jump and move in to attack.</text>

	<text>Avatars are often called ghosts. Perhaps their translucent nature frightens off ships from this part of the cosmos.</text>
	<text>Avatars inhabit this nebula — artificial intelligence, holograms similar to ghosts. Even Slugs dare not venture into this place.</text>
	<text>Rumors suggest that ghosts inhabit these parts. Like it or not, soon you'll find out for yourself.</text>
	<text>This nebula seems suspiciously quiet, even for a nebula. Keep your guard up.</text>
	<text>You don't like the sounds that are heard in this place from time to time... a crewman complains of constant headaches because of them.</text>
	<text>Only Slug ships sometimes run the risk of flying into this dangerous of a nebula. The Rebels however, will stop at nothing.</text>

	<text>The distress call was transmitted by a heavily battered civilian vessel. Ghosts attacked their trade convoy, and although the civilians managed to escape, on one of the ships, its built-in artificial intelligence system went insane and tried to kill its own crew by seizing control of the ship and mind controlling them. If you manage to damage the ship's AI very strongly, before their crew dies, they promise to thank you.</text>
