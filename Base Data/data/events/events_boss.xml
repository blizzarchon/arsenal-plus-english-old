<!-- mr_easy_money says:
] I changed the tully box stuff to reflect the new blueprint removal.
	note that I split the event in two because the augment is removed from inventory by the next event, not before then,
	otherwise you get an 'over capacity' prompt, one augment in the discard area, but only two in the regular slots.
	results in weird empty discard area if you move the augment that's there to the last open regular slot.
] I changed 'thoroughly prepared' to 'thoroughly yet quickly prepared'
] I figured out the right idiom and capitalized 'base':
changed 'at any price to defend the Federation base' to 'defend the Federation Base at all costs' -->

	<text>You arrive in the middle of a raging battle. Both sides are taking heavy losses. A small squadron flies past and a fighter breaks off, moving toward your position.</text>
	<text>Two fleets fight nearby. You try to skirt around the edges of the battle and keep out of weapons range, but a Rebel scout spots you and moves in.</text>
	<text>It's hard to tell who is winning the nearby battle. Before you have a chance to figure it out, a fighter moves in to attack.</text>
	<text>The sheer scale of the destruction in the distance is almost breath-taking. Unfortunately, your position as an independent observer doesn't last for long!</text>
	<text>The destruction in the distance is almost awe-inspiring. However you're dragged back to reality as Sensors indicate you are under attack.</text>
	<text>You don't have any time to worry about the battle in the distance. The fight is coming to you really quickly!</text>
